U-Net and Mask R-CNN are both popular models for image segmentation, but they differ significantly in architecture, use cases, and capabilities.

üîç Quick Summary
Feature	U-Net	Mask R-CNN
Task	Semantic segmentation	Instance segmentation
Output	Class label per pixel (no object distinction)	Pixel-wise masks for each detected object
Architecture	Encoder-decoder with skip connections	Backbone + RPN + ROIAlign + segmentation head
Use case	Medical imaging, satellite images	COCO-style object segmentation (multi-object)
Object Separation	No (merges overlapping objects)	Yes (separates individual object masks)

üî¨ 1. What is U-Net?
Type: Semantic Segmentation

Architecture:

Encoder (downsampling via conv + pooling)

Decoder (upsampling via transposed conv)

Skip connections from encoder to decoder

Strength:

Works well on small datasets

Accurate pixel-wise prediction

Simple and fast to train

Example use-cases:

Medical imaging (e.g., tumor segmentation)

Agricultural segmentation

Any task where you want per-pixel classification without separating individual objects

üï∏Ô∏è 2. What is Mask R-CNN?
Type: Instance Segmentation (combines object detection + segmentation)

Architecture:

Backbone: CNN (e.g., ResNet + FPN)

Region Proposal Network (RPN): Suggests candidate object regions

ROIAlign: Extracts features for each region

Heads: Predict bounding box, class, and binary mask for each instance

Strength:

Detects and segments multiple objects

Each object gets a separate mask

Example use-cases:

Detecting and segmenting multiple people, cars, animals, etc.

COCO-style datasets

Tasks needing both object detection and segmentation

üéØ When to Use What?
Problem Type	Use This Model
Segmenting lungs, tumors, or organs	U-Net
Segmenting 10 different overlapping cars	Mask R-CNN
Pixel-wise land cover segmentation	U-Net
Detecting and segmenting every person in image	Mask R-CNN
