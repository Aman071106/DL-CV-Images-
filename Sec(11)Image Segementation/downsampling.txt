= it is same as pooling and its function is to prevent overfitting and reducing noise by reducing resolution in cnns

note: conv layers also do downsampling provided ((n-f+2p)/s +1)!=n


no of channels is the no of features
and 
w*h is resolution

note:(only for feature reduction)
    there for feature reduction or increase we should use 1*1 convolution .This will ensure that resolution will not change.
