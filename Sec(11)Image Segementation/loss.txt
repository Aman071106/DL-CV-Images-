| Dice Loss                                         | CCE                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Good for region overlap & class imbalance         | Good for pixel-wise class precision    |
| Handles small/rare classes well                   | Provides strong early training signals |
| Can struggle with softmax calibration             | Encourages sharp class probabilities   |
| Works poorly alone in noisy or multi-class setups | Complements Dice's weaknesses          |
