//From sec8 to rest we will look upon several available :
- Architectures
- Pre trained modesl
- Data sets
- competitions
- problem identification
- newerr loss functions and metrics etc 



//there are many other models,datasets and tech stack,parameters as discussed in courses. But here we will realize how to explore or what else cann be there.
These things arrise from large competitions etc.



//in tf and keras we should use there transformers or utils by seeing from doc or elsewhere instead of sklearn

Overall--
#receptive field
#as we go deeper we can do increase in no of kernels for extracting high level features
#stride generally 1 or 2
#Normalization
#Skip connections
# Parallerly multiple layers than concatenate
